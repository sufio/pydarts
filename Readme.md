Python library to interact with [Unicorn Smartboard](https://www.unicornsmartboard.com) and count dart scores.

Inspired by the [reverse engineering of the dartboard](https://github.com/kcapp/smartboard/wiki/Reverse-Engineering) done by Thord Setsaas.

Created by [the Sufio team](http://sufio.com/jobs/) for our interactive dartboard game at the PyCon 2022 conference.
